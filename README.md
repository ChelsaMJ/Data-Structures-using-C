# LPU - Data Structures: Deep Dive Using C by E-Box
## Mini Projects

## Overview

This repository contains four mini-projects developed as part of the **LPU - Data Structures: Deep Dive Using C** course. Each project explores a different aspect of data structures and algorithms, utilizing C to implement core concepts like binary search trees, linked lists, and file handling. These projects provide practical applications of data structures to solve real-world problems.

## 1. Binary Search Tree

**Description:**
This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C, allowing for the insertion, searching, deletion, and traversal of nodes. The BST is a key data structure that supports efficient operations on sorted data.

**Features:**
- Insert nodes into the BST.
- Search for nodes based on a key value.
- Delete nodes from the BST.
- In-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal methods.
- Calculate the height of the tree.
- Count the number of nodes.

**How to Run:**
Compile and run the C file. You will be prompted to input values for BST operations.

## 2. Student Register (Using Linked Lists)

**Description:**
This project simulates a simple student registration system using linked lists. Each student's details, such as name, date of birth, and contact information, are stored dynamically in a linked list structure.

**Features:**
- Add a new student.
- Display all student records.
- Delete all student records.

**How to Run:**
Compile and run the C file. The program provides a menu-driven interface for adding, viewing, and deleting students.

## 3. Phonebook Management System

**Description:**
The Phonebook Management System allows users to store, search, update, and delete contact information. This project demonstrates file handling in C, along with the implementation of a user and admin interface for data management.

**Features:**
- Add, update, and delete contacts.
- Search for contacts by name, number, or city.
- Persistent storage of contacts using file handling.

**How to Run:**
Compile and run the C file. Choose between user and admin modes, then perform operations using the menu-driven interface.

## 4. Students Grade Checker

**Description:**
The Students Grade Checker project utilizes a Binary Search Tree (BST) to manage student records and check their grades. This project focuses on efficiently storing and searching student records using their unique identification code.

**Features:**
- Insert new student records.
- Search for a student by code.
- Print all student records in ascending order.
- Filter students based on grade threshold.

**How to Run:**
Compile and run the C file. Use the menu to add students, search by code, and filter students by grade.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ChelsaMJ/data-structures-mini-projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd data-structures-mini-projects
   ```
3. Compile and run any of the projects using a C compiler, for example:
   ```bash
   gcc -o bst binary_search_tree.c
   ./bst
   ```
